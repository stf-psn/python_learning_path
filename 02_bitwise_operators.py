# 101   (5 in binario)
# & 011   (3 in binario)
#------
# 001   (Risultato: 1 in decimale)

# A comparison between the two bits is done.
# A 0 is returned, when using the and bitwise operator, if the bit doesn't match.
# Since the last bit matches, a 1 is returned.

# 1001   (9 in binario)
# | 0110   (6 in binario)
# ------
#  1111   (Risultato: 15 in decimale)
# At least one bit was one, during the OR comparison.

# 1010   (10 in binario)
# ^ 0110   (6 in binario)
# ------
#  1100   (Risultato: 12 in decimale)

# During the XOR comparison, if the bits are not the same and at least one bit is one, the value is one, else 0.
